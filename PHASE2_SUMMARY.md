# Phase 2: Enhanced Phonemizer Implementation

## Objective
Improve the refactored word-based phonemizer to provide more accurate phoneme conversion with proper handling of:
- Shaddah (gemination) marks
- Tatweel (elongation) characters
- Proper association of diacritics with base letters
- Implementation of Tajweed rules for phoneme conversion

## Current Status
The refactored phonemizer has successfully modularized the core components:
- `Location` class for handling word positions
- `Word` class for representing Quranic words with detailed structure
- `Symbol` hierarchy for different character types
- `Rule` abstract base class for future Tajweed rule implementations
- `WordProcessor` class for orchestrating phoneme conversion
- `PhonemizeResult` class for holding results

The modularization has been validated through test and demo scripts.

## Phase 2 Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Parsing Logic
- Improve `parse_word` function to properly associate diacritics with base letters
- Handle shaddah marks by associating them with their base consonants
- Process tatweel characters correctly
- Maintain proper symbol ordering and relationships

### 2. Tajweed Rule Implementation
- Implement concrete rule classes that inherit from the `Rule` abstract base class
- Add Idgham rules (merging rules)
- Add Ikhfaa rules (concealment rules)
- Add Qalqala rules (echoing rules)
- Add Iqlab rules (conversion rules)

### 3. Phoneme Conversion Accuracy
- Map base letters and their associated diacritics to correct phonemes
- Handle geminated consonants properly
- Implement proper vowel lengthening rules
- Ensure phoneme output matches the original phonemizer's accuracy

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Create comprehensive tests for new parsing logic
- Validate phoneme output against the original implementation
- Test edge cases and special character combinations
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing API

## Technical Approach

### Enhanced Symbol Relationships
The current symbol parsing creates individual symbol objects but doesn't properly associate diacritics with their base letters. In Phase 2, we'll:
- Modify the `Word` class to maintain relationships between symbols
- Create helper methods to identify base letters and their associated marks
- Implement proper symbol grouping logic

### Rule Processing Pipeline
- Extend the `WordProcessor` class to apply actual Tajweed rules
- Implement rule matching logic to identify when rules should be applied
- Create phoneme conversion methods that respect Tajweed principles

### Configuration Management
- Enhance the YAML configuration loading to support rule definitions
- Create mappings for complex phoneme conversions
- Implement rule priority and conflict resolution systems

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Symbol Parsing**:
   - Modify `parse_word` to associate diacritics with base letters
   - Handle special cases like shaddah and tatweel
   - Update the `Word` class structure to maintain symbol relationships

2. **Implement Core Tajweed Rules**:
   - Start with basic rules like Idgham and Ikhfaa
   - Create rule classes with specific apply logic
   - Test rule application on sample verses

3. **Enhance Phoneme Mapping**:
   - Update the phoneme conversion logic to handle complex cases
   - Ensure accurate representation of Quranic pronunciation
   - Validate output against scholarly sources

4. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Create test cases for each implemented rule
   - Compare output with original phonemizer
   - Document any discrepancies and resolve them

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, the refactored phonemizer should:
- Accurately parse and represent Quranic word structures
- Apply Tajweed rules correctly to produce proper phonemes
- Match or exceed the phoneme accuracy of the original implementation
- Maintain the modular, extensible architecture
- Provide detailed debugging capabilities for verification

## Challenges

- Properly handling the complex relationships between Arabic characters
- Ensuring all edge cases in Quranic text are covered
- Maintaining consistency with established Tajweed principles
- Balancing accuracy with performance considerations
