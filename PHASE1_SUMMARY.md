# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation done in Phase 1 of the phonemizer refactoring.

## Overview
In Phase 1, we've successfully refactored the phonemizer to use a word-based approach instead of the original token-based approach. We've also modularized the code by separating classes into individual files.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Word-Based Processing
- Transitioned from token-based to word-based phonemization
- Created data structures that better represent the linguistic components of Quranic text

### 2. Modularized Code Structure
We've separated the monolithic `phonemizer_refactored.py` file into multiple modular files:

- `core/symbols.py`: Contains all symbol-related classes
  - `Symbol` (abstract base class)
  - `LetterSymbol`
  - `DiacriticSymbol`
  - `ExtensionSymbol`
  - `StopSymbol`
  - `OtherSymbol`

- `core/location.py`: Contains the `Location` class for tracking word positions

- `core/word.py`: Contains the `Word` class with a debug printing method

- `core/rule.py`: Contains the `Rule` abstract base class

- `core/word_processor.py`: Contains the `WordProcessor` class for orchestrating phonemization

- `core/phonemize_result.py`: Contains the `PhonemizeResult` class for results

### 3. Debugging Support
- Added a `debug_print()` method to the `Word` class
- Created `debug_verse.py` script to visualize word structures

### 4. Core Functionality
- `load_words()`: Load words for a reference range from the Quran database
- `parse_word()`: Parse a word text into a `Word` object with `Symbol` instances
- `Phonemizer.phonemize()`: Main phonemization method that returns `PhonemizeResult`
   - Catch-all for any other symbols

#### `Word` Class
- Central data structure representing a single word
- Contains `location`, `symbols`, `text`, and `stop_sign` attributes
- Includes helper methods `first_letter()` and `last_letter()`

### 2. Data Loading and Parsing

#### `load_symbol_mappings()`
- Loads symbol mappings from `base_phonemes.yaml`

#### `parse_word()`
- Parses a word text into a `Word` object with `Symbol` instances
- Handles different symbol types based on the mappings

#### `load_words()`
- Loads words for a reference range
- Uses the existing `load_db()` and `keys_for_reference()` functions

### 3. Processing Framework

#### `Rule` Abstract Base Class
- Defines the interface for Tajweed rules
- Has an abstract `apply()` method

#### `WordProcessor` Class
- Orchestrates the conversion of a `Word` to its phonemes
- Can apply rules to modify phonemes

#### `PhonemizeResult` Class
- Holds the result of the phonemization process
- Contains reference, text, and phonemes

#### `Phonemizer` Class
- Main phonemizer class for the refactored implementation
- Has a `phonemize()` method that processes references

## Key Features

1. **Word-based Processing**: The new implementation processes words individually rather than using a token-based pipeline.

2. **Structured Data**: Symbols are now properly categorized into different types with specific attributes and methods.

3. **Extensible Design**: The rule system is designed to be extensible for future phases.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: The implementation uses the same data sources (`Quran.json`, `base_phonemes.yaml`) as the original.

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created to verify the functionality:

- Basic phonemization of single words and verses
- Handling of different reference formats
- Processing of symbols and generation of phonemes

## Next Steps

Phase 1 provides a solid foundation for the refactored phonemizer. Future phases will implement:

- More sophisticated rule processing
- Complex Tajweed rules (Ikhfaa, Idgham, Qalqalah, etc.)
- Advanced phoneme conversion logic
- Full replacement of the original pipeline system

The implementation is ready for Phase 2, which will focus on basic phoneme conversion and stop/start rules.
